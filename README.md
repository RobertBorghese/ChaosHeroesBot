# Chaos Heroes Bot
A LINE and Discord bot for retrieving and calculating information regarding the mobile game [Chaos Heroes](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/chaos-heroes/id1492673616).

## Requirements

Requires [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) and compontent enough knowledge of coding to modify and run the code yourself.

## How to edit and Run in your own bot in LINE

First go to https://developers.line.biz/console/channel/new?type=messaging-api, sign into your LINE account and register new "Messaging API"/"Channel" (I don't know why they call it something weird like "Channel", what they mean is your LINE Bot).

Once you've created it, it should open "Basic Settings", scroll down and get "Channel secret" and "Assertion signing key". Write these down somewhere.

Download this code (top-right green button).

Open "Command Prompt"/"Terminal", type `cd [path-to-unziped-folder-you-downloaded-from-here-in-last-step]`, and hit enter.

Type `node bot.js`, hit enter.

The bot should now run.
